<h1 class="chapnum1">Sustainable Democracy &#x02013; Challenges to Strong Political Institutions</h1>

<p class="aff">Linnaeus University, Sweden</p>
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page13" aria-labelledby="pg13"></span><span id="pg13" hidden="hidden">13</span>The United Nations&#x02019; Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16 and the targets related to the importance of strong institutions, such as Target 16.6 concerning the need to &#x0201C;develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels" and Target 16.7 regarding how to &#x0201C;ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision making at all levels" have several key challenges. One such challenge is that the targets never explicitly address the issue of what kind of strong institutions they refer to, nor do they address democracy as a system in relation to strong institutions. Consequently, the concepts of sustainable democracy and strong institutions need to be somewhat linked to the concept of democracy. In addition, when focussing on South Africa itself, the most recent government report, about how well the country is meeting the SDGs (2023), does not make any &#x0201C;further judgement" about the targets addressing strong institutions. In the 2023 report, it seems to be the intention to judge the strength of institutions based on how well public institutions perform concerning health, education, and climate change and to what extent both men and women participate in these institutions. However, the report does not describe any results (e.g., insufficient/no data; see <a href="#ref02-44">Republic of South Africa, 2023</a>, pp. 218&#x02013;219). In conclusion, to understand the meanings of Targets 16.6 and 16.7, one must relate them to the concept of democracy.</p>
<p class="indent">This chapter focusses on SDG 16 and challenges in South Africa to establish strong political institutions as included in Targets 16.6 and 16.7 (for judicial institutions, see Heydenrych). The second section elaborates on the analytical approach of democracy in relation to sustainable democracy, mainly through liberal representative democracy and participatory democracy, including equalitarian aspects. The third section deals with democratic development in South Africa between 1994 and 2024 and the contemporary status of liberal and participatory democracy. In the fourth section, some of the most important challenges involved in making the country more democratic are raised. One important challenge is the <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page14" aria-labelledby="pg14"></span><span id="pg14" hidden="hidden">14</span>electoral aspect of the African National Congress (ANC) as being the dominant political force for decades. A second type of challenges involves some of the most important negative aspects of ANC&#x02019;s domination, such as the checks and balances in the parliamentary system, the widespread political corruption, the phenomenon of state capture, weak and inefficient leadership, and the fact that emerging parties over time tend to increase populism and political polarization. A third discussed challenge is how participation at national and local levels has decreased over time. At the same time, people&#x02019;s support for democracy as a system has also decreased. Finally, some notes about what has been done to tackle and improve the SDG 16 on strong institutions are discussed with concluding remarks.</p>

<h2 class="head1">Theoretical Departure: Liberal and Participatory Democracy</h2>
<p class="noindent">In relation to democracy, it is obvious that the objective behind Goal 16 stems from somewhat different ideas rooted in liberal representative democracy and participatory democracy. The concept of liberal democracy departs from <a href="#ref02-47">Schumpeter&#x02019;s (1947</a>) electoral democracy, in which democracy refers to when a majority of people elect the executive and legislative formal power in free and fair elections; people have access to freedom of speech, press, and assembly; and when no illegal constitutional actions are allowed to take place. However, liberal democracy takes this further; Robert <a href="#ref02-10">Dahl&#x02019;s (1971</a>) polyarchy has been the most respected concept, including aspects such as control over governmental decisions, freedom of expression, right to criticism of all officials, access to alternative sources of information, and enforced right to form and join autonomous associations. However, to further understand representative democracy in relation to Goal 16, one must also add Larry Diamond&#x02019;s concept of liberal democracy, which is applied in this chapter. This concept includes aspects such as having free and fair elections and individual political rights, as in Schumpeter and Dahl&#x02019;s work, in addition to emphasizing proper checks and balances, rule of law, and extensive collective and cultural rights. As <a href="#ref02-11">Diamond (1996</a>, p. 24) pointed out, &#x0201C;Cultural, ethnic, religious, and other minority groups, as well as traditionally disadvantaged or unempowered majorities, are not prohibited (legally or in practice) from expressing their interests in the political process, and from using their language and culture." Consequently, Diamond&#x02019;s view of democracy includes the objective of &#x0201C;effective, accountable and transparent institutions" and the need &#x0201C;to ensure a responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision making." This is highly relevant to establish and develop strong, sustainable democratic institutions.</p>
<p class="indent">To further strengthen aspects of participation and democracy, one also must include various aspects of participatory and equalitarian democracy. Therefore, the second model of democracy is participatory democracy, as we have seen in the literature by Caroline <a href="#ref02-40">Pateman (1970</a>) and Benjamin R. <a href="#ref02-6">Barber (1984</a>) among others. Participatory democracy, in this combined version, includes an idea that the process of decision-making is more important than the content of the decisions themselves. Additionally, all social relations in society should be democratized under equal conditions, and the people should be part of all national and <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page15" aria-labelledby="pg15"></span><span id="pg15" hidden="hidden">15</span>local political decision-making and in all spheres of society such as the workplace, educational institutions, and housing. Inclusion is also an essential part, but most of these socio-economic issues are covered in other parts of this book. Therefore, in this chapter, attention will be narrowed down to participation.</p>

<h2 class="head1">The Democratic Development and the Current Status of Democracy</h2>
<p class="noindent">Since South Africa shifted to democracy in the early 1990s, the country has had a rather stable representative democratic system, in which all elections have been free and fair, without regular fraud, unfairness, or irregularities. In addition, civil and political rights have been widely respected. The most important aspect of checks and balances in the parliamentary system has been the right to vote no confidence against the government or any other official administrator. However, over time, the ANC won all national elections and grew to become too dominant, which resulted in a challenged mechanism of checks and balances in South Africa&#x02019;s parliamentary system.</p>
<p class="indent">The 1994 election was the first one to be completely free and fair, in which all adults, regardless of race, were allowed to cast their vote (<a href="#ref02-17">Freedom House, 1995</a>). The ANC won by a landslide, with about 62.5&#x00025;, followed by the National Party (NP) with 20.4&#x00025; and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) with 10.5&#x00025; (<a href="#ref02-17">Freedom House, 1995</a>; <a href="#ref02-26">IEC, 1994</a>). After the election, a new government of national unity was established under the leadership of ANC&#x02019;s Nelson Mandela, the Nationalist Party, and the IFP. The former president of the previous apartheid government, F. W. de Klerk, became the first vice president of the new government of national unity (<a href="#ref02-17">Freedom House, 1995</a>). This was a part of the transition and constitutional pact between the former enemies. After the election, South Africa increased significantly on the Freedom House democracy index (scale of 1&#x02013;7, where 1 is the top score), moving from 5 to 2 for political rights and from 4 to 3 points for civil liberties (<a href="#ref02-16">Freedom House, 1994</a>, p. 507, <a href="#ref02-17">1995</a>, p. 519). The ANC with Mandela&#x02019;s presidency became the major force in the National Assembly. When the 1996 constitution was drafted, the NP decided to maintain in the Government of National Unity but left it in 1998. Meanwhile, the IFP remained in government.</p>
<p class="indent">In keeping with its core principles, democracy improved under Mandela&#x02019;s presidency (1994&#x02013;1999). His presidency was primarily focussed on the process of national reconciliation between the old white apartheid system and the black society, but this administration also developed South Africa&#x02019;s mixed economy with some more market-oriented reforms. In addition, his presidency involved welfare reforms. However, crime had increased, and corruption was about to grow in the public sector and within the ANC. Still, when Mandela left office in 1999, the democracy score had improved to 1 (from 2 in 1994) for political rights and 2 (from 3 in 1994) for civil liberties in Freedom House&#x02019;s annual democracy reports (<a href="#ref02-18">Freedom House, 2000</a>, p. 444).</p>
<p class="indent">During the presidency of the ANC Thabo Mbeki (1999&#x02013;2008), the progress of democracy in South Africa began somewhat to halt. Several aspects contributed to this halting process, such as more political corruption, political violence during elections, the government&#x02019;s sensitivity to media criticism, and the accusation that the state-owned South African Broadcasting Corporation <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page16" aria-labelledby="pg16"></span><span id="pg16" hidden="hidden">16</span>(SABC) was too ANC biased (<a href="#ref02-19">Freedom House, 2009</a>). After the dominant fraction within, the ANC accused Mbeki of intervening in the judicial process against ANC leader Jacob Zuma&#x02019;s prosecution for corruption, Mbeki left office. Next, Freedom House lowered South Africa&#x02019;s democratic score on political rights to 2 (from 1), though civil liberties remained at 2 (<a href="#ref02-19">Freedom House, 2009</a>, p. 654). At this point, the phenomenon of state capture began evolving, characterized by overly close relations among state apparatuses, where the ANC and the state became almost the same thing, and it became obvious under Zuma&#x02019;s presidency (<a href="#ref02-49">Southall, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">ANC won the 2009 and 2014 elections, but Zuma was forced to leave office by 2018 after years of political turmoil, corruption allegations, and finally the ANC&#x02019;s motion of no confidence in the parliament against him (<a href="#ref02-9">Bracking, 2018</a>; <a href="#ref02-38">Mlambo, 2019</a>). Parallel to the political turmoil, the term &#x0201C;state prisoner" or &#x0201C;state capture" was institutionalized as concepts to describe the widespread political corruption under Zuma&#x02019;s years in office (<a href="#ref02-7">Basson &#x00026; du Toit, 2017</a>; <a href="#ref02-49">Southall, 2019</a>). Still, by 2019 and during Zuma&#x02019;s time in office, South Africa scored 2/2 on Freedom House&#x02019;s annual freedom ratings (<a href="#ref02-21">Freedom House, 2020</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa won the 2019 general national election with 57.5&#x00025; of the vote (<a href="#ref02-31">IEC, 2019</a>). However, like former President Zuma, Ramaphosa had also been accused of questionable business practices, corruption, and failure to address South Africa&#x02019;s economic challenges over the years, thereby facing the threat of impeachment (<a href="#ref02-1">Africa News, 2020</a>). Still, some actions were taken to combat corruption. In October 2022, after the Zondo Commission came up with strategies to handle corruption, an independent public procurement agency was established to protect whistleblowers. In 2023, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, a public protector intended to safeguard democracy, was impeached due to incompetence and misconduct. In addition, some other prominent ANC politicians went to trial for corruption, such as Ace Magashule, former ANC secretary and one of Zuma&#x02019;s close friends (Fraioli, <a href="#ref02-22">Freedom House, 2024</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">A hung parliament was expected in the 2024 national election due to several factors: the ANC&#x02019;s long-term power in government; the widespread corruption within the political system and in society; new political competition from former president Zuma&#x02019;s new party, uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK); and the Freedom Fighters and the new alliance expressed by signing the Multi-Party Charter, including the Democratic Alliance (DA) and the IFP (<a href="#ref02-12">Everatt, 2024</a>; <a href="#ref02-23">Freedom House, 2025</a>). However, the ANC maintained its power in government and seized the presidency, but with only 40.19&#x00025; of the votes, it was forced to join a coalition &#x02013; a national unity government with the second-largest party, the DA (which won 21.81&#x00025; of votes) and the two smaller parties, the IFP and the right-wing Patriotic Alliance (PA; see <a href="#ref02-32">IEC, 2024</a>; <a href="#ref02-41">Phakathi et al., 2025</a>). One might think that a new unitary government in office would lead to a more stable democratic route in South Africa, and it might be so, if the ANC and DA agree to disagree, but polarization has also increased, in which the government is challenged both by left-wing and right-wing populism (<a href="#ref02-41">Phakathi et al., 2025</a>; <a href="#ref02-53">Vilakati &#x00026; Bentley, 2025</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">To conclude, the democratic status of South Africa has been relatively stable but with a slightly negative development during the last decade; the level of democracy has been more or less maintained regardless of whether it is measured as a liberal or participatory democracy. <a href="#fig1">Fig. 2.1</a> illustrates the liberal democracy <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page17" aria-labelledby="pg17"></span><span id="pg17" hidden="hidden">17</span>status in South Africa since the transition from apartheid to democracy in the early 1990s.</p>

<h2 class="head1">Challenges to SDG 16 in the Political Society</h2>
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page18" aria-labelledby="pg18"></span><span id="pg18" hidden="hidden">18</span>After a relatively rapid democratic transition with the first free and fair election, a new democratic constitution, and increased civil and political rights, democracy has been in a slow decline over the last two decades, particularly since Zuma entered the political stage in the around 2005. During the transition and under the leadership of Nelson Mandela, one has to admit that the ANC acted with a mentality to forgive and move forward despite all the negative consequences the apartheid system had created for colored people in South Africa. Also, the first years under Nelson Mandela was seen as a promising path for the country. However, all national elections, except in 2024, have ended with a major ANC hegemony, which have had several negative consequences, and challenges as well, for the political system and the democratic path. These challenges include corruption and state capture, weak checks and balances, poor leadership, political polarization, and decreased participation and lack of support for democracy.</p>
<section id="ch02-lev2-1">
<h3 class="head2">Electoral Outcome and ANC Domination</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are several important factors related to the development of the ANC&#x02019;s political hegemony as the dominant political party (<a href="#ref02-12">Everatt, 2024</a>; <a href="#ref02-14">Ferim, 2013</a>; <a href="#ref02-34">Lancaster, 2016</a>; <a href="#ref02-35">Lodge, 2004</a>). One is Samuel P. <a href="#ref02-25">Huntington&#x02019;s (1991</a>, p. 267) two-turnover test, which is an important measure of good governance and democracy for at least two reasons. First, it relates to a strong commitment among all political leaders and parties to give up office after losing an election. If it happens back and forth over some decades, the game of democracy becomes more routinized. You win and you lose elections, and that gives all actors a certain perception of the essence of the democratic system; you must deliver something to be able to win the next election. The second factor has to do with the consequences of something goes wrong in society that is related to politics. Then, in most cases, the government must leave office after the next election. South Africa has so far not had any change of government, as the ANC has maintained in power. However, this does not mean that South Africa is not a democracy per se &#x02013; it practices free and fair elections, and the assumption is that a change of government will happen if the election results in a victory for the opposition. So far, South Africa has had one transition from the apartheid government to the ANC-dominated unity government in 1994, but since then, there have only been ANC governments with various presidencies, with no changes of government between the ruling ANC party and the opposition. Simply put, there has been no government turnover at the national level between 1999 and 2024. At the regional and local levels, there have been turnovers, but the fact that ANC has been a dominant party in South African politics is still a challenge. However, with the 2024 election and the unitary government, there might be a possibility of change in the rule of politics in South Africa, which is likely to affect all consequences of a too-dominant ANC, including aspects of checks and balances and how to handle state capture and corruption.</p>

<section id="ch02-lev2-2">
<h3 class="head2">State Capture, Weak Checks and Balances, Poor Leadership, and Political Polarization</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page19" aria-labelledby="pg19"></span><span id="pg19" hidden="hidden">19</span>Several scholars have emphasized the importance of ANC&#x02019;s total dominance and its consequences in the post-apartheid period (<a href="#ref02-15">Ferree, 2010</a>; <a href="#ref02-24">Habib, 2013</a>; <a href="#ref02-33">Khambule et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#ref02-35">Lodge, 2004</a>). According to the literature, one-party&#x02013;dominant democratic states are more likely than countries with other party systems to develop phenomena such as state capture, despotism, protection networks, corruption, and economic destruction (see <a href="#ref02-14">Ferim, 2013</a>; <a href="#ref02-37">Masenya, 2017</a>). It is easy to understand what happened, for example, during President Zuma&#x02019;s years in office. In South Africa, the Zuma presidency (2009&#x02013;2018) experienced growing corruption, a lack of transparency, and several issues related to horizontal checks and balances within the political system, although the ANC, as the majority party, could have practically avoided most of this due to its dominant role (<a href="#ref02-33">Khambule et al., 2019</a>). <a href="#fig3">Fig. 2.3</a> (scale &#x02212;2 to 2) shows that the government&#x02019;s ability to deal with corruption in South Africa has regressed since democracy was put in place, and no clear trend break has been seen since 2015; rather, the opposite seems to be taking place.</p>

Between 2010 and 2016, the index fluctuates narrowly around 0 with minor increases. After 2016, the trend continues downward, remaining slightly below 0 from 2018 onwards and ending near negative 0.3 in 2022, reflecting weakened control of corruption over time.</p></details>

<p class="indent">In addition, because the ANC has had a very dominant role in the National Assembly, it has also been difficult to challenge the government through the existing checks and balances without an internal demand within the ANC. Caroline <a href="#ref02-34">Lancaster (2016</a>) summarized this as follows:</p>
<p class="block">South Africa&#x02019;s post-Apartheid era (1994 onward) has been marked by the uninterrupted electoral success of the African National Congress (ANC), largely due to its &#x0201C;monopoly" on anti-Apartheid discourse and support. <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page20" aria-labelledby="pg20"></span><span id="pg20" hidden="hidden">20</span>In recent years, ANC has tightened its grip on power upon the realization that it has become virtually unaccountable, as the chance of electoral defeat is nearly non&#x000AD;existent. (p. 371)</p>
<p class="indent">This also affects the checks and balances that secure the democracy in South Africa, because the political system is based on a parliamentary system. However, there are major differences in South Africa from the standard Westminster model (see <a href="#ref02-43">Pypers &#x00026; Pothier, 2015</a>). The South African Parliament has an oversight role over the president and the cabinet, needs to approve legislations, and can raise a vote of confidence. However, Parliament is not sovereign regarding the constitution nor in relation to the judiciary system. In addition, Parliament appoints the president, but contrary to the Westminster model, the president, not Parliament, appoints the cabinet. The key is, however, that when one party dominates the scene over a long period of time, the notion of no confidence becomes more of an internal matter (in this case, for the ANC) rather than a tool to be used by the opposition. This was the case when Mbeki and Zuma were abandoned internally by the ANC and replaced by other ANC leaders (<a href="#ref02-13">Eyewitness News (EWN), 2017</a>; <a href="#ref02-45">Reuters, 2008</a>; <a href="#ref02-50">
<i>The Guardian</i>, 2008</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Another aspect of the ANC&#x02019;s domination is the lack of policy implementation and poor leadership (<a href="#ref02-37">Masenya, 2017</a>). As concluded in the chapter about inequality, South Africa is more unequal today than it was during the apartheid period (<a href="#ref02-36">Makgetla, 2020</a>; <a href="#ref02-54">World Bank, 2022</a>). It is a good example of the lack of policy implementation as well as the state-capture system, involving widespread corruption and weak and ineffective leadership at all levels &#x02013; national as well as local &#x02013; as the ANC&#x02019;s commitment to combat poverty and decrease inequality has completely failed. This trend started during the last year of Mbeki&#x02019;s presidency but culminated during Zuma&#x02019;s presidency. The <a href="#ref02-55">Zondo Commission (2022</a>) concluded that a large portion of state resources has been systemically redirected by internal (ANC-related) and external actors to win as much financial and other personal gain as possible (<a href="#ref02-42">Public Affairs Research Institute (PARI), 2022</a>). The ANC, as the dominant party, became the state, and the state is seen as the ANC, but with weak leadership and widespread corruption at all levels.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="#ref02-34">Lancaster (2016</a>) gave two main explanations for why South Africa ended up with a system in which one party dominates. The most important is that South Africa, at local as well as national levels, has followed historical racial and ethnic fragmented lines. There is also a trend of political polarization. At the beginning of the transition in the early 1990s and just after it, the ANC and the Nationalist Party, later transformed into the DA, established a unitary government. However, when the unitary government was replaced by a pure ANC government after the election in 1999, and particularly after the ANC won several elections with an overwhelming majority, the development became polarized. At first, on one side was the ANC, mostly representing black people, and on the other side was the DA, representing white people. In addition, when the ANC&#x02019;s long period of rule did not solve the issue of socio-economic inequality between colored and <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page21" aria-labelledby="pg21"></span><span id="pg21" hidden="hidden">21</span>white people in South Africa, corruption emerged. After some internal disputes within the ANC, former ANC youth leaders and other left-wing sympathizers founded the Freedom Fighters, a new party, in 2013. South Africa became even more fragmented and polarized, not only between black and white people but also from an even more radical perspective. In the 2019 election, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) had support from 10.79&#x00025; of the population in the National Assembly, thereby making it the third-largest party in the country after the ANC and the National Alliance. However, the party has also somewhat been controversial, not only for its Marxist&#x02013;Leninist approach and its agenda for economic emancipation but also because of its antidemocratic, more authoritarian position (see <a href="#ref02-46">Roberts, 2019</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, other parties have been centered on the Zulus or regional foundations (such as the IFP), the United Democratic Movement (the Eastern Cape Province), or white people in line of the DA. Consequently, politics were not mainly founded on ideological concerns. The ANC became the catch-all party among black people. However, step by step, polarization increased among previous supporters of the ANC. This extended into the 2024 election, ahead of which former president Zuma launched a new left-wing party, MK (<a href="#ref02-12">Everatt, 2024</a>). MK was named after a militant former ANC member, and it heavily attacked the ANC for collaborating with the apartheid system and being in favor of the white monopoly capital. In addition, the Freedom Fighters continued to oppose the ANC from the left-wing position. The DA also accused the ANC of pushing the entire country into a fire after launching an advertisement on TV showing a South African flag on fire. To conclude, the campaign became very polarized, and the ANC was attacked from at least two angles. At the same time, after the elections, ANC lost its majority, and the left-wing radical parties represented by the MK and EFF received about 25&#x00025; of the mandates.</p>
<p class="indent">With a somewhat new unitary government and the two key actors from the historical transition to democracy back in the 1990s, the ANC and the DA, a new chapter of politics has been opened. Still, as Leepo Johannes <a href="#ref02-39">Modise (2025)</a> framed it, South Africa &#x0201C;is marred by a high rate of Poverty, Unemployment, and Inequality (PUI) &#x02013; a stark contrast to the ideal of democracy as the sharing of power and economic resources." Though we have witnessed this trend on regional and local levels, it has now evolved at the national stage. Of course, the deep ideological and political divisions and somewhat polarized society remain, but in government, at least the two major contenders have agreed to disagree. How it will end is, of course, an open question (<a href="#ref02-41">Phakathi et al., 2025</a>). It might give rise to some stability, and as the ANC gradually loses its domination over politics, the phenomena of state capture and corruption will probably weaken gradually.</p>

<h3 class="head2">Decreased Participation and Lack of Support for Democracy</h3>
<p class="noindent">Aspects of participation manifest in models of representative democracy and in various participatory democracy models. One could perhaps expect even better development regarding the participatory and egalitarian aspects because the <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page22" aria-labelledby="pg22"></span><span id="pg22" hidden="hidden">22</span>progressive ANC has been in power since democracy was implemented. However, as in the case of liberal democracy, the development has not been positive (as <a href="#fig4">Fig. 2.4</a> shows); it has in fact been in an even greater decline over the last two decades. The same trend holds if one considers a separate democracy index of equalitarian democracy, which measures whether people from various parts of society are engaged in democracy. With some minor ups and downs, the trend is that South Africa has not improved these aspects at all since the transition to democracy, nor since 2015.</p>
<figure class="image" id="fig4">

<details id="kfig2_4"><summary>Long Description for Figure 2.4.</summary>
<p class="noindent">The chart tracks South Africa&#x2019;s Egalitarian Democracy Index ratings from 2006 to 2023 on a scale from 0 to 1. The line starts near 0.5 in 2006 and remains relatively stable throughout the period. Small fluctuations are observed, with slight rises around 2010 and 2020, and minor declines around 2014 and 2018. Overall, the index stays consistently close to 0.5, showing minimal long-term change in egalitarian democracy levels.</p>

<p class="indent">One challenge is that the percentage of people participating in national elections has decreased over time. In 1999, it peaked at 89.30&#x00025;, but since then, the turnout rate has declined to 66&#x00025; in the 2019 election and to 58.66&#x00025; in the 2024 election (<a href="#ref02-17">Freedom House, 1995</a>, <a href="#ref02-18">2000</a>, <a href="#ref02-21">2020</a>, <a href="#ref02-23">2025</a>). Therefore, the trend has been very negative. However, this does not stand out in comparison to parliamentary elections in other countries such as Ghana (2000: 60&#x00025;, 2016: 63.86&#x00025;) and Botswana (1994: 76.7&#x00025;; 2019: 84.15&#x00025;). The same trend in South Africa can be seen for local and regional elections across the country; participation was 73.48&#x00025; in 2014 and 58.64&#x00025; in the 2024 elections (<a href="#ref02-17">Freedom House, 1995</a>, <a href="#ref02-18">2000</a>, <a href="#ref02-20">2015</a>, <a href="#ref02-21">2020</a>, <a href="#ref02-23">2025</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Another aspect is support for democracy or the concept that a large majority of the people at least recognize democracy as preferable to other forms of government (e.g., as opposed to any type of authoritarian rule). Several factors stand out when looking at support for democracy in South Africa. The first is that public support for democracy has never exceeded 72&#x00025; (<a href="#ref02-2">Afrobarometer, 2016/2018</a>). This is a good number, but the percentage has reached over 80&#x00025; in other democratic countries such as Botswana and Ghana in recent years, and neighbouring Namibia has also increased its support for democracy, leaving South Africa <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page23" aria-labelledby="pg23"></span><span id="pg23" hidden="hidden">23</span>behind (<a href="#ref02-2">Afrobarometer, 2016/2018</a>). The second point is that over time, between 15&#x00025; and 20&#x00025; &#x02013; and, in recent years, more than 30&#x00025; &#x02013; of the population has conveyed a strong belief that a nondemocratic government would be a better option, indicating that some citizens would recognize any authoritarian regime as a better alternative (<a href="#ref02-2">Afrobarometer, 2016/2018</a>). Third, support for democracy peaked in South Africa around 2010, moving from around 60&#x00025; in 1994 to 72&#x00025; in 2010, but it fell to around 40&#x00025;&#x02013;60&#x00025; during Zuma&#x02019;s time in office (<a href="#ref02-2">Afrobarometer, 2016/2018</a>, <a href="#ref02-3">2021/2023</a>), and it has maintained around 40&#x00025; in recent years. The number of people who support a nondemocratic government has also increased slightly over time but with some variations. <a href="#tab1">Table 2.1</a>, with data from <a href="#ref02-3">Afrobarometer (2021/2023</a>), illustrates this trend.</p>

<h2 class="head1">Conclusion</h2>
<p class="noindent">South Africa made a tremendous transition to democracy, where the ANC was a major part of that achievement. Now the country has one of the most democratic constitutions in the world, with several checks and balances, as in all parliamentary systems, but the key problem has been the domination of one party (the ANC), which has affected almost everything in relation to checks and balances, accountability, transparency, and effectiveness. The development of the ANC and the <span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page24" aria-labelledby="pg24"></span><span id="pg24" hidden="hidden">24</span>state-capture phenomena, including aspects such as corruption, weak leadership, and weak implementation of policies, can be seen as a consequence of the fact that when a party has more than 50&#x00025; of the seats in the parliamentary system over two decades, the checks and balances become an internal affair (e.g., within the ANC).</p>
<p class="indent">In relation to Goal 16 and strong institutions as set out in Targets 16.6 and 16.7, concerning effective, accountable, and transparent institutions as well as inclusive, participatory, and representative decision-making, two factors stand out in South Africa. One major problem with the issue of accountable and transparent political institutions has to do with the extremely dominant role of the ANC, leaving most of the checks and balances in the parliamentary system up to internal ANC discretion. Still, one must keep in mind that between 1994 and 2024, South Africa has held free and fair national elections without any major fraud. During this period, the ANC has received between 40&#x00025; and 69&#x00025; of the vote, thereby securing a clear majority in the National Assembly for most of the time, except in the last elections. It has maintained its position in the government, and Parliament has elected an ANC president after every election. During these elections, the DA, the successor of the Nationalist Party, became the main opposition but has been part of the new unitary government (again) since 2024. Consequently, the ANC has completely dominated the national political scene, which of course has had implications for how the political system and democracy work in practice.</p>
<p class="indent">The other point is that developing inclusive and representative democracy among all social groups requires solving the extreme poverty and existing inequalities between rich and poor, white and colored people, educated people and workers, employed versus unemployed, etc. So far, after the return to democracy, this has remained an open issue. In fact, as concluded in the chapter about inequality, South Africa is worse off now compared to before the ANC came to power. In 2012, South Africa presented a National Development Plan (<a href="#ref02-48">South Africa National Planning Commission (SA NPC), 2012</a>) to combat poverty and reduce inequality by 2030; however, no sign of achieving the plan&#x02019;s goals has been presented. Additional policies to combat poverty and inequality have been proposed as well as general plans to develop democratic participation (<a href="#ref02-5">Auriacombe &#x00026; Meyer, 2020</a>). As mentioned in the chapter about the judiciary system, some judicial reforms to combat corruption have been implemented as well, but so far, they have not changed the overall situation. The most important and recent one is the initiation of the Zondo Commission (the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture, Corruption, and Fraud in the Public Sector, including Organs of State), which drew its final conclusions in 2022 regarding allegations of state capture, corruption, and fraud in South Africa. Strong evidence was presented, and several officials and other persons are named in the report (<a href="#ref02-55">Zondo, 2022</a>). Since then, it has been up to the judicial system and political institutions to follow up on all the evidence. In addition, according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), South Africa has tried to implement various policies to enhance inclusive participation in politics, such as those concerning the roles of women, youth, and unemployed people (<a href="#ref02-51">UNDP, 2024</a>). Still, however, there are no signs of overall improvement.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" id="page25" aria-labelledby="pg25"></span><span id="pg25" hidden="hidden">25</span>With the new unitary government in place since 2024 and with a new trend of more populistic parties, both to the left and the right, polarization in South Africa is growing. After the 2024 national election, South Africa is at a crossroads. On one hand, the new unitary government, including both the ANC and the DA, could be a turning point in a real effort to combat the phenomena of state capture and widespread corruption. On the other hand, it could also tip to the other side, prompting more polarization, populism, and an increasing path toward support for the left- and right-wing political forces.</p>
